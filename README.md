# Project Description

This attempt seeks to predict housing prices using Zillow's dataset. The ultimate objective is to craft a robust machine learning model that enterprises can deploy for accurate house price predictions.

# Project Goals ü•Ö
- The project aims to create a machine learning model to predict the value of single-family homes accurately, using key property details.
- Another goal is to find out what major factors affect the tax values of single-family homes sold in 2017.
- Finally, the results will be shared with Zillow's lead data scientist and other important team members.

# Initial Questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è
1. Why do some properties have a much higher value than others when they are located so close to each other?
2. Why are some properties valued so differently from others when they have nearly the same physical attributes but only differ in location?
3. Is having 1 bathroom worse for property value than having 2 bedrooms?
